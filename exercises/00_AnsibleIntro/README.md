# What is Ansible

Ansible is a tool that helps you automate and manage computers and systems across different platforms. It’s widely used by IT teams and has become a popular choice for large organizations that want to simplify and speed up their operations.

Supported by **Red Hat** and a strong open-source community, Ansible is great for **configuring systems, setting up infrastructure, and deploying applications**.

It can automate almost anything—from cloud and on-premise servers to IoT devices—making your IT environment **faster, more consistent, and more reliable**.

# Ansible automation

Ansible works using two types of machines: a **control node** and **managed nodes**. The control node is the computer where Ansible is installed. From there, it connects to the managed nodes and sends them commands and instructions.

The pieces of code that Ansible runs on managed nodes are called **modules**. Each module is triggered by a **task**, and a list of tasks forms a **playbook**. In a playbook, you describe what the system should look like or what actions should happen.

All managed machines are listed in a simple **inventory file**, which can group them into different categories.

Ansible uses **YAML**, an easy-to-read language, to define playbooks, so you can understand and write them from the very beginning.

One big advantage of Ansible is that it **doesn’t need any agent software** installed on the managed machines—making setup and use very straightforward.

In most cases, all you need is a **terminal** to run commands and a **text editor** to write your configuration files.
