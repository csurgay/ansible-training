# What is Ansible

Ansible is software that enables cross-platform automation and orchestration at scale and has 
become the standard choice among enterprise automation solutions. It’s mostly addressed to IT 
operators, administrators, and decision-makers, helping them achieve operational excellence 
across their entire infrastructure ecosystem.

Backed by RedHat and a loyal open-source community, it is considered an excellent option for 
configuration management, infrastructure provisioning, and application deployment use cases. 

Its automation opportunities are endless across hybrid clouds, on-prem infrastructure, and 
IoT and it’s an engine that can greatly improve the efficiency and consistency of your IT 
environments.

# Ansible automation

Ansible works using two types of machines: a control node and managed nodes. The control node 
is the computer where Ansible is installed. From there, it connects to the managed nodes and 
sends them commands and instructions.

The pieces of code that Ansible runs on managed nodes are called modules. Each module is 
triggered by a task, and a list of tasks forms a playbook. In a playbook, you describe what 
the system should look like or what actions should happen.

All managed machines are listed in a simple inventory file, which can group them into different 
categories.

Ansible uses YAML, an easy-to-read language, to define playbooks, so you can understand and 
write them from the very beginning.

One big advantage of Ansible is that it doesn’t need any agent software installed on the managed 
machines—making setup and use very straightforward.

In most cases, all you need is a terminal to run commands and a text editor to write your 
configuration files.
