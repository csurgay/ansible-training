### Search for Modules

`ansible-doc` is a built-in cli tool for quick reference on Ansible modules and module usage.

Use `-l` or `--list` for a complete list of installed modules to find something you need. 

`ansible-doc -l | grep firewall`

```
local@builder:~$ ansible-doc -l | grep firewalld
ansible.posix.firewalld
ansible.posix.firewalld_info
```

---
### Module Usage Template

Use the `-s` or `--snippet` option for a module template with complete list of arguments with explanations.

`ansible-doc -s firewalld`  

```
local@builder:~$ ansible-doc -s firewalld
- name: Manage arbitrary ports/services with firewalld
  firewalld:
      forward:               # The forward setting you would like to enable/disable to/from zones
                             # within firewalld. This option only is
                             # supported by firewalld v0.9.0 or later.

                             # As of Ansible 2.3, permanent operations
                             # can operate on firewalld configs when it
                             # is not running (requires firewalld >=
                             # 0.3.9). Note that if this is `false',
                             # `immediate=true' by default.

      protocol:              # Name of a protocol to add/remove to/from firewalld.

      state:                 # (required) Enable or disable a setting. For ports: Should this port

                             # operations (i.e. when no other parameters
                             # but zone and state are set).

      zone:                  # The firewalld zone to add/remove to/from. Note that the default zone c>

                             # default from upstream. Available choices
                             # can be extended based on per-system
