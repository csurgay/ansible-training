---
### In this section the following subjects will be covered

1. Variable names
1. Usage
1. Registered variables
1. Nested (complex) variables
1. Variable Precedence
1. Magic variables
1. Connection variables
1. Prompt variables

---
### Variable names

+ Only letters, numbers and unserscores
+ Cannot redifine keywords and internal variables
+ Cannot start with number

---
### Usage

#### Define

```yaml
my_var: 123
other: "string with spaces"
path_variable: /etc/ansible/hosts
list_var:
  - first
  - second
  - third
dictionary:
  name: John
  born: 1970
```

#### Reference (Jinja2 syntax)

```yaml
message: Value of other is {{ other }}.
quoted_if_starts_with: "{{ my_var }}"
list_item: "{{ list_var[0] }}"
str: "{{ dictionary['name'] }}:{{ dictionary['born'] }}"

# Value of other is string with spaces.
# 123
# first
# John:1970
```

---
### Registered variables

Output of an Ansible Task can saved into variables (registering into variables). The `register: <var>` keyword is used. These newly created variables can later be tested for the success or the result of a Task's execution.

```yaml
- name: Illustration of register
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: date
  register: date_result
```

#### Best practice for registered variables

- **Descriptive variables names**

Use clear and meaningful names when you create registered variables in your playbooks. This helps you and your teammates quickly understand what each variable contains. For example, names like disk_usage_output or nginx_status are much better than generic ones like result or output.

- **Avoid overusing registered variables**

Only register output when you actually need the data for later tasks. Storing unnecessary results can make your playbook harder to read and add clutter to the task output. A clean playbook is easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

- **Use debug for troubleshooting**
  
When developing a playbook, use the debug module to print the contents of a registered variable. This helps you see the variable’s structure and make sure you’re using the right attributes in your conditions or loops. You can add and remove these debug tasks as needed during development.

- **Handle failures**

If a task might fail but you still want the playbook to continue, use ignore_errors: true. This way, Ansible will keep running but still save the result for later checks. You can use the rc (return code) value in conditions to decide what to do next. This keeps your playbooks flexible and reliable across different systems.

### Nested (complex) varaibles

If a query or calculation returns nested (complex) object in a variable, the structure can be unnested if two ways:

+ Bracket notation (`ansible_facts['python']['version']['major']`)
+ Dot notation (`ansible_facts.python.version.major`)

---
### Variable Precedence

> [!WARNING]
> Variables with the same name can be defined in 20+ different places of the Ansible ecosystem. They will override each other according to their location, according to Variable Precedence.

> [!TIP]
> Keep it simple. Define variables in only one place, thus avoid Ansible Precedence.


Variables can be defined in several places, e.g:

+ Roles
+ Inventory
+ Playbooks/Plays
+ Include files
+ Command line

Ansible will load each and override the ones with the same names, thus Precedence is applied.

#### Inventory variables

Precedence from lowest to highest:

- `all`
- parent group
- child group
- host

#### world_inventory

```yaml
washington

[france]
paris myvar:host_highest

[germany]
hamburg
hannover

[europe:children]
france
germany

[europe:vars]
myvar: child_group

[china]
beijing
shanghai

[asia:children]
china

[world:children]
europe
asia

[world:vars]
myvar: parent_group

[all:vars]
myvar: all_lowest
```

#### In yaml format

```bash
ansible-inventory -i ./world_inventory --list --yaml`
```

#### outputs

```
all:
  children:
    ungrouped:
      hosts:
        washington:
          myvar: all_lowest
    world:

                shanghai:
                  myvar: parent_group
        europe:
          children:
            france:
              hosts:
                paris:
                  myvar: host_highest
            germany:
              hosts:
                hamburg:
                  myvar: child_group
                hannover:
                  myvar: child_group
```

#### In JSON format

```bash
ansible-inventory -i ./world_inventory --list`
```

#### outputs

> [!NOTE]
> The above directory layout is best practice, where Playbooks are mappings of a set Roles to a set of Inventory.

> [!WARNING]
> The sheer number of locations for Variable definitions are impossible keep track of.

> [!TIP]
> Avoid Precedence conflicts by planning Variable placement and name Variables differently if possible.

### Magic variables

Magic variables are automatically set by Ansible and can be used to get information specific to a particular managed host.

#### Most used Magic variables :

| Magic variable | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`hostvars`** | Used to get another managed host's variables. Includes facts after `gather_facts=true` |
| **`group_names`** | All the groups the current managed host is member of |
| **`groups`** | All ths groups and hosts of the current inventory |
| **`inventory_hostname`** | Hostname of the current managed host from the inventory. This may be different from the host name reported by facts for various reasons. |

#### Usage examples

```bash
ansible host1     -m debug -a 'var=hostvars["host2"]'
ansible host2     -m debug -a 'var=hostvars'
ansible all       -m debug -a 'var=hostvars.host3.ansible_version.string'
ansible host1     -m debug -a 'var=group_names'
ansible localhost -m debug -a 'var=groups'
ansible host1     -m debug -a 'var=inventory_hostname'
```

---
### Connection variables

Connection variables are placed into inventory to control how Ansible connect to hosts individually. Some of them also have default values, even without explicit definition.

#### Most used Connection variables:

| Magic variable | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`ansible_hostname`** | The actual name of the host (not neccessarily the inventory alias inventory_hostname, which is the default value) |
| **`ansible_port`** | Might not be 22 for some hosts, but has no default value unless defined |
| **`ansible_user`** | Define this if host is connected to with some other user |
| **`ansible_become`** | Same as --become for the host in the inventory, no default value |
| **`ansible_become_user`** | Same as --become-user for the host in the inventory, no default value |

#### Sample Inventory usage

```yaml
[testnode]
localhost

[application]
frontend ansible_host=host1 ansible_user=bob ansible_become=true
backend ansible_host=host2
appserver ansible_host=host3
```

#### Sample Playbook usage
```yaml
# Playbook to illustrate inventory_hostname vs. ansible_hostname
---
- name: inventory_hostname vs. ansible_hostname
  hosts: all
  become: false
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:

    - name: Print hostnames
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: |
          {{ inventory_hostname }} is {{ ansible_host }}:{{ ansible_port | default('22') }}
          {{ ansible_user }} {{ ansible_connection }}
```

---
### Prompt variables

```yaml
---
- name: Prompt variables
  hosts: host1
  gather_facts: false
  vars_prompt:
    - name: username
      prompt: What is your username?
      private: false
    - name: password
      prompt: What is your password?
    - name: packagename
      prompt: What would you like to install?
      private: false

  tasks:

    - name: Print a message
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: 'Username:{{ username }} Password:{{ password }} <- bad practice'

    - name: Install packagename
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: "{{ packagename }}"
        state: present
```
