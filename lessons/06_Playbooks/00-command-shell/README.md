# Command, Shell

### In this lesson the following subjects are covered

1. Set up your Ansible project directory
1. Prepare an `inventory` file
1. Prepare a simple `ansible.cfg` config file 
1. Smoke test Ansible can access your inventory hosts

---
## Set up your Ansible project directory
```bash
cd
mkdir playbook
cd playbook
```

---
## Prepare an inventory file
```bash
vim host_inventory
```
#### host_inventory
```yaml
[controlnode]
localhost

[myhosts]
host1
host2
host3
```

---
## Prepare a simple ansible.cfg config file
```bash
vim ansible.cfg
```
#### ansible.cfg
```yaml
[defaults]
interpreter_python=/usr/bin/python3
result_format=yaml
```

---
## Smoke test Ansible can access your target hosts
```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

---
## Write a simple Playbook

- Playbooks are yaml files, so they always start with `---`
- Good practice to start Playbooks with a descriptive yaml comment above the `---`
- Playbooks are a yaml list of Plays, so each Play start with `-` (yaml list item)
- Plays are a header followed by a tasklist
- Header is a yaml dictionary, so key-value pairs, colon appended to keys
- Always `name:` your Plays in the first key-value pair so that you can navigate you output and logs
- Other header keys are
  - `hosts:` for set of actual target hosts
  - `become:` for the privilege escalation on the Managed Hosts
  - `gather_facts:` to spend time on or omit the gathering of system facts from Managed Hosts
  - `tasks:` is the yaml list of modules of this Play to execute on the Managed Hosts

So far we have:

```yaml
# Descriptive comment of this Playbook
--- 
- name: Play description
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
```

Under tasks you enlist all modules of this Play to be executed on the Managed Hosts.

In the Tasks section `tasks:` is the key, and its value is a yaml list of multiple Tasks.
Every one Task is a yaml list item that consitst a yaml dictionary with keys like

+ `name:` to have a description of the Task that can also be found in output and logs
+ a module name like `ansible.builtin.debug` where the value is a yaml dictionary of arguments for this module
+ `register:` to record the result of the Task into a new variable
+ `loop:` if you need to run the Task multiple times over the `item`s of a list
+ `when:` if you only want to run the Task on some conditions
+ `become:` if you need to cause or prevent privilege escalation only for this Task
+ `ignore_errors:` of you need to keep on executing the Play even if this Task fails on a Managed Host
+ `no_log`: if you don't want the result of this Task in your output or logs

In this lesson we have two modules to learn

+ ansible.builtin.command
+ ansible.builtin.debug

in two Tasks as follows:

```yaml
# Descriptive comment of this Playbook
--- 
- name: Play description
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:

    - name: Uptime
      ansible.builtin.command: uptime
      register: result_uptime

    - name: Print result
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: result_uptime.stdout_lines
```
