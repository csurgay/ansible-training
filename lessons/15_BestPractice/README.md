## General Principles

- Use **YAML** instead of JSON for readability.  
  - YAML is easier to read and maintain than JSON. 
- Keep **consistent indentation** and spacing.  
  - Consistent indentation ensures files parse correctly and improves readability. 
- Write **clear comments** describing tasks.  
  - Comments clarify why tasks exist. 
- Follow **consistent naming** for tasks, variables, roles, and files.  
  - Naming conventions help you locate and understand tasks, variables, and roles. 
- Store projects in **version control** (e.g., Git).  
  - Version control tracks changes and simplifies collaboration. 
- Use **ansible-lint** and **molecule** for linting and testing.  
  - Linting and testing ensure reliability. 
- Use **tags** to organize and run specific tasks.  
  - Tags help run only specific parts of a playbook.
- **Start simple** and expand gradually.
  - Starting simple reduces complexity and prevents errors.

## Recommended Project Structure

```
inventory/
  production
  staging
  test

group_vars/
  web.yml
  db.yml

host_vars/
  web01.yml
  db01.yml

library/
module_utils/
filter_plugins/

site.yml
web.yml
db.yml

roles/
  webserver/
    tasks/main.yml
    handlers/main.yml
    templates/web.conf.j2
    files/setup.sh
    vars/main.yml
    defaults/main.yml
    meta/main.yml

  database/
    tasks/main.yml
    handlers/main.yml
```

To create a new role skeleton:

```bash
ansible-galaxy role init <role_name>
```

- Separate inventories per environment prevent mistakes. 
- Group and host variable directories organize configuration and reduce duplication. 
- Custom modules and plugins are stored in dedicated folders. 
- `site.yml` orchestrates smaller playbooks for modularity. 
- Roles include tasks, handlers, templates, files, variables, defaults, and metadata for reuse. 
- Using `ansible-galaxy role init` reduces setup errors.

---
## Inventory Management

Inventories define which hosts Ansible manages. Proper inventory practices ensure tasks run correctly.

- Group hosts logically (by function, environment, or location).  
- Keep separate inventories for each environment (`production`, `staging`).  
- Use **dynamic inventories** for cloud or changing environments.  
- Use **group_by** to create runtime groups.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Group by OS
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create OS-based groups
      group_by:
        key: os_{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}
```

Conditional plays:

```yaml
- hosts: os_Ubuntu
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "Ubuntu specific configuration"
```

- Logical grouping simplifies targeting tasks and ensures correct execution. 
- Separate inventory files avoid mistakes in multiple environments. 
- Dynamic inventories help manage changing hosts in cloud environments. 
- `group_by` dynamically assigns hosts to groups at runtime. 
- Conditional plays allow running tasks only on specific hosts, improving efficiency and reducing risk.

---
## Playbooks and Task Design

- Always **declare the desired state**.  
- Put **each argument on a separate line**.  
- Group related tasks with **blocks**.  
- Use **handlers** for triggered actions.  
- Use a top-level playbook (`site.yml`) to orchestrate smaller playbooks.

Example task:

```yaml
- name: Create application user
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: "{{ app_user }}"
    state: present
    uid: 1100
    generate_ssh_key: true
  become: true
```

Example block:

```yaml
- name: Install and configure web server
  block:
    - name: Update cache
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        update_cache: true
        cache_valid_time: 3600

    - name: Install nginx
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Deploy configuration
      template:
        src: templates/nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  when: ansible_facts['distribution'] == 'Ubuntu'
  tags: web
  become: true
```

Handler example:

```yaml
handlers:
  - name: Restart nginx
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
```

- Declaring states ensures tasks behave as expected. 
- Separate lines for arguments improve readability. 
- Blocks group related tasks, simplifying management and error handling. 
- Handlers run only when changes occur, improving efficiency. 
- Top-level playbooks provide orchestration and modularity.

---
## Debug Practicies

Regiser result of all tasks, then debug based on success.

```yaml
- name: Install EDB server packages
  dnf:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ edb_server_packages }}"
  register: result_install

- debug:
    var: result_install
  when: result_install is failed
```

---
## Variable Management

- Define **defaults** in `roles/<role>/defaults/main.yml`.  
- Use `group_vars` and `host_vars` directories.  
- Prefix variable names with role or context names to avoid conflicts.

Example:

```yaml
webserver_port: 8080
database_port: 5432
```
- Keep variable logic simple.
- Defaults provide fallback values. 
- Group and host variables organize configuration per host or group. 
- Prefixing names prevents collisions. 
- Proper quoting ensures correct interpretation. 
- Simple variables reduce complexity and improve readability.

---
## Module Usage

- Place custom modules in `./library`.  
- Prefer **idempotent modules** over `shell` or `command`.  
- Always specify **state**.  
- Combine similar actions using lists.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Install packages
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    name:
      - curl
      - unzip
      - git
    state: latest
```

- Custom modules in the library are automatically available. 
- Idempotent modules ensure safe repeatable operations. 
- Explicit states clarify intended behavior. 
- Using lists avoids repetitive code and improves readability.

---
## Roles

Roles group tasks, handlers, and variables into reusable components.

- Roles should perform one clear function.
  - If multiple functions are mixed in one role, reusability suffers
- Follow **Ansible Galaxy** structure.  
  - Galaxy standards improve readability. 
- Keep roles **focused** and loosely coupled.  
  - Loosely coupled roles are reusable. 
- Use **import_role** or **include_role** for execution control.  
  - Importing roles controls execution order. 
- Validate and store external roles locally.
  - Storing validated roles locally avoids dependency issues.

---
## Execution and Deployment

- Test in **staging** before production.  
  - Testing in staging prevents production mistakes. 
- Limit execution using `--limit` or `--tags`.  
  - Limiting execution targets the desired hosts or tasks. 
- Preview execution with `--list-tasks`, `--list-hosts`, `--check`, `--diff`.  
  - Previewing shows what would happen. 
- Resume partial runs with `--start-at-task "<task name>"`.  
  - Provides for faster debugging
- Use `serial` for **rolling updates**.  
  - Rolling updates prevent downtime by updating hosts in batches. 
- Explore [execution strategies](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_strategies.html).
  - Execution strategies optimize task performance in large deployments.


---
## Security Practices

- Use **Ansible Vault** or external secrets managers.  
  - Vault encrypts sensitive information. 
- Limit `become` usage to necessary tasks.  
  - Limiting privilege escalation reduces risk. 
- Apply **RBAC** and governance controls.  
  - RBAC gives fine-grained access control. 
- Scan for vulnerabilities regularly.  
  - Regular scans identify issues. 
- Log and monitor executions centrally.
  - Logging and monitoring provide audit trails and help troubleshoot.
- Use **`no_log`** to prevent logging sensitive data.

---
## Additional Notes

- Ensure **idempotency** across all tasks.  
  - Idempotent tasks are safe to run multiple times. 
- Use **role dependencies** carefully.  
  - Careful role dependency management keeps roles modular. 
- Integrate **dynamic inventories** for hybrid environments.  
  - Dynamic inventories simplify hybrid deployments. 
- Combine provisioning and configuration when possible.
  - It reduces complexity.
